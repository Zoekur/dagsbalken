## 2024-05-23 - Avoiding Object Allocation in Widget Updates
**Learning:** App Widgets updated via `WorkManager` or `AlarmManager` (like `LinearClockWidgetReceiver`) run frequently. Allocating objects like `Paint` inside the generation loop adds unnecessary GC pressure, even if it's "only" once a minute.
**Action:** Use `ThreadLocal<Paint>` for stateless helper objects in singletons that are called from potentially concurrent contexts (Glance composition).
