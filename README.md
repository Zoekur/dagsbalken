# Dagsbalken
### Visualizing time as a cognitive and design problem

## Project overview

**Dagsbalken** is an Android-based design and research project that explores how time can be made more cognitively accessible through visual representation. The project approaches time not merely as a measurable unit, but as an experienced phenomenon shaped by cognition, context, and everyday practice.

The core idea is to represent the day as a **linear time bar**, making the passage of time, remaining time, and transitions between activities visible and immediately understandable. Rather than optimizing for productivity or efficiency, Dagsbalken prioritizes **clarity, orientation, and self-regulation**.

The project is developed as part of ongoing academic work within informatics and behavioral science, and functions simultaneously as:
- a design exploration  
- a prototype-based research project  
- a long-term portfolio artifact

## Background & motivation

Traditional representations of time—clocks, calendars, schedules—are highly abstract. They require users to continuously translate numerical or symbolic information into meaning and action. Research within behavioral science, UX, and accessibility has shown that this abstraction can create friction, stress, and exclusion, particularly for individuals with differences in executive functioning (e.g., ADHD).

Dagsbalken is motivated by the question:

> *What if time did not need to be calculated — but could simply be seen?*

By externalizing time visually, the project aims to reduce cognitive load and support:
- temporal awareness  
- predictability  
- transitions between activities  
- everyday self-organization

## Design & theoretical foundation

The project is situated at the intersection of:

- **Informatics** – information representation, sociotechnical systems, UX/HCI  
- **Behavioral science** – cognition, self-regulation, executive functions  
- **Design research** – research through design, exploratory prototyping  

Time is treated as information that can be structured, visualized, and interacted with, rather than as a neutral background variable.

From a design perspective, the project emphasizes:
- low information density  
- clear visual hierarchy  
- consistency over configurability  
- visual affordances rather than textual explanation  

The interface is intentionally minimal, aiming to support understanding rather than control.

## Project principles & design integrity

Dagsbalken is developed as an exploratory design and research project grounded in both theory and lived experience. The project’s core lies not in the technology itself, but in **how people perceive, interpret, and relate to time in everyday life**.

### Ownership and authorship  
The project’s problem formulation, core design idea, and value foundation remain author-owned. These elements are considered non-negotiable, even in collaborative or organizational contexts.  
Technical implementation and further development may take place in collaboration, provided that the project’s integrity is preserved.

### Purpose before performance  
Dagsbalken prioritizes meaning, clarity, and cognitive support over productivity metrics or optimization. Success is not measured solely by scale or adoption, but by alignment with the project’s original purpose.

### Collaboration on clear terms  
Collaboration with external actors is welcomed when it:
- respects the project’s core intent  
- is transparent and time-bounded  
- allows for reversible decisions  
- does not compromise authorship or direction  

Collaboration is treated as a means, not an end.

### Decision-making principle  
Irreversible decisions that affect ownership, direction, or values are postponed until the project has reached sufficient maturity.  
Reversible decisions that enable learning and exploration are encouraged early.

### Helping without erasure  
Reaching many users is a desirable outcome, but not at the cost of the project’s identity. Scalability and dissemination are secondary to conceptual integrity.

Dagsbalken is not bound to a single course, organization, or timeframe. It is allowed to evolve organically, at a pace that is sustainable for its author.

## Technical overview

- **Platform:** Android  
- **Language:** Kotlin  
- **UI framework:** Jetpack Compose  
- **Architecture focus:** declarative UI, modularity, visual hierarchy  

The technical implementation serves the design intent rather than the other way around. Code is treated as a medium for exploration and iteration, not as the primary research object.

## Academic & portfolio context

The project is developed within the context of interdisciplinary studies combining informatics, pedagogy, psychology, and sociology, with a strong emphasis on:
- information systems in organizational contexts  
- UX and digital services  
- project-based, cross-disciplinary collaboration  

Dagsbalken is designed to function as:
- a portfolio project demonstrating design reasoning and systems thinking  
- a prototype suitable for user studies and qualitative evaluation  
- a potential foundation for a future bachelor’s thesis in informatics  

---

## Status & future directions

Dagsbalken is an ongoing project. Current and potential future directions include:
- user testing and qualitative interviews  
- comparison of alternative time visualizations  
- accessibility-focused design iterations  
- exploration of organizational or educational contexts  
- critical reflection on time, control, and digital support systems  

The project is intentionally not “finished”. Its value lies in continued inquiry rather than closure.
